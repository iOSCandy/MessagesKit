# MessagesKit
UILibrary for adding`Messages` like features to your app based on JSQMessagesViewController

The simple goal of this library is to make it easy to add chat to your app.
We would like everything to be customisable but also to work by default. A developer should be able to add this framework to their project and with minimal setup be up and running. That is the goal at lest.

###Timeline

We would like to get V1 out as soon as possible so we will be putting together a very trimmed down version at first and add features progressivly. 

Version 1 requirements. 

- Swift 3
- Input bar with send button.
- Message layout
- MessageDatasourceProtocol
- Message Bubble
- Navigation
- Tests


There is a ton to get done and it cannot all be done by one guy. Any help that can be rendered is appriciated. Understand that people have other obligations and this is a free product produced by this community. This is a safe place to learn and grow. Be courtiouse and kind if something is not working fix it. 


Thanks for all of your help.
